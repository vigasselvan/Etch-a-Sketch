# Etch-a-Sketch

Browser version of sketchpad

you can select the each box size in the selected screen by selecting "Squares per side" button and giving your input not more than 100.

## Issues and Learnings:

1. to play with css inside js.
2. to make reload effect, after user given their input for "sq per side", to set sq size with the button present as earlier.
